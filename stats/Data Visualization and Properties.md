# Graphs
some graphs are better at other things than others. Like how pie charts are better at representing parts of a whole rather than the amount of different categories. You wouldn't use a pie chart to represent the amount of people in an age group.

# Means
Means can only tell us so much about some data set. A mean tells us only about central tendencies. The mean might be the same for two different data sets, but one data set might be completely different than the other. Set A might have a cluster around the mean and set B might be spread out much further than set A. 

# Range
Range is simply calculated as $range = max value - min value$. This is pretty simplistic view of range. A much more common measure of dispersion is *variance*. Which describes how closely the values of a data set are clustered around the mean. 
population variance: $$\sigma ^2 = \frac{\sum^{N}_{i=1}(y_i - \mu)^2}{N}$$sample variance: $$s^2 = \frac{\sum^{n}_{i=1}(y_i - \bar{y})^2}{n-1}$$
