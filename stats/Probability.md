# Definitions
**Event** - The outcomes resulting from experiments
Probability Properties:
- Probability of an event has to lie between 0 and 1, \[0,1\]
- The sum of probabilities of all events of an experiment is *always* 1. 
**Classical Probability** - We have a more "absolute" notion of how to calculate probability. We know enough about a system to count the number of outcomes that occur and the number of ways event $A$ can occur.
*Ex*: event $A$: pick a winning lottery number. Experiment: a lottery with a 6 digit number.
$$P(A)=\frac{1}{10^6} = \frac{1}{1000000}$$ **Relative Frequency** - We use past history to extrapolate ideas about the occurrence of events.
$$P(A) = \frac{number \: of \: ways \: A \: has \: occured \: in \: the \: past}{total \: number \: of \: outcomes \: witnessed}$$

- Student passing rates
**Subjective Probability** - probability assigned to an event based on a subjective judgment.
- Sports gambling
**Marginal Probability** - The probability of an event occurring.
**Conditional Probability** - The probability of an event occurring on the condition of a second event happening. Written as $P(A\mid B)$.
**Mutually Exclusive** - Two or more events that can't happen at the same time. 
**Complementary Events** - The complement of event $A$. Written as $A^c$ or $A'$. $A^c$ is *everything but* $A$. $P(A) + P(A^c) = 1$.

**Union and Intersections** - Intersection ($\cap$) means "and".  Typically means multiply the probabilities together. Union($\cup$) means "or". Typically means to add the probability of the events together. $A \cup B = B \cup A$.
**Multiplication Rule** - If you have joint events $A$ and $B$, $P(A \cap B) = P(A\mid B)P(B)$. $P(B \cap A) = P(B \mid A)P(A)$. If events $A$ and $B$ are independent, $P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)$.
