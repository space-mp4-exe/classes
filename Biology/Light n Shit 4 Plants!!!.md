plants r grean. they should be black. u-plants r red, because the wadder. 
chlorophyll r y they grean. They have a lot of different pig mens.
Chlorophyll $\alpha$, chlorophyll $\beta$, and carotenoids make them green.
carotenoids make them redder in the fall.

# Photosynthesis
**Granum** - the disks that do photosynthesis. 
Chlorophyll's intermembrane space does not store a proton concentration gradient
*NADPH* - like NADH, but for plants. used in calvin cycle.
**Calvin cycle** (carbon fixation) - $CO_{2} \to$ Glucose. Happens in the stroma

Light - dependent reactions take place in *photosystems*.
Light $\to$ Photosystem-II $\to$ Photosystem-I $\to$ ATP. 
Photosystem-II makes $H^+$ gradient for ATP synthase for the chloroplast. Photosystem-I reduces NADP$^+$. 
**ATP does not leave the chloroplast**
Thylakoid space is basically intermembrane mitochondria space.
