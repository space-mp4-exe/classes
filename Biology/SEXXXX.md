# Mitosis
Cells divide thru mitosis
**mitosis stages** 
Interphase - growth
Prophase - chromosomes form 
Metaphase - chromosomes line up in the center 
Anaphase - sister chromatids pull apart 
Telophase - cell pinches in the middle 

**Apoptosis** - programmed cell death, cell suicide. They explode.

# Cell Life Cycle
$G_1 \to$ grow 
$G_{0} \to$ Growth done. Normal cell function. No division.
$S\to$ DNA replication occurs
$G_{2}\to$ Double mitotic proteins. "Getting ready to divide".
$M\to$ Go thru mitosis and division

**Cell Regulation** 
**Proto-oncogenes** - Promote cell division
**Tumor suppressor Genes** - Regulate checkpoints. When mutated, they cant stop the cell cycle.

**Check Points** 
$G_{1}/S$ - "Should we divide?" growth factors
$G_{2}/M$ - "DNA copied correctly?"
Spindle checkpoint - "Are spindles working?"

# DNA replication

**DNA replication proteins**
Helicase - Unwinds DNA
Binding proteins - Stabilize each strand
Primase - Adds short RNA primer to template strand
DNA polymerase - Binds nucleotides to form new strands
Ligase - Creates covalent bond between adjacent DNA segments

Polymerase can only add new DNA from the 5' end towards the 3' end and only to an existing template strand. There are two strands in DNA, they go in different direction. This means that one polymerase follows the helicase separating the DNA (the leading strand) and one has to jump around because it can only make DNA in one direction (the lagging strand). The fragments that the lagging strand has are called Okazaki fragments. 

When Helicase unwinds DNA, it could cause extra twisting in the DNA. The extra twisting can damage the DNA, so we use something called gyrase to stop the torsional strain.

Every time DNA gets replicated, a little bit of DNA gets lost at the end. To combat this, we have filler DNA called telomeres. Telomerase extend the telomeres. 

# Meiosis
**Gametes** - cells used in reproduction that have half as many chromosomes as regular (somatic) cells. 
Gametes are **haploid**, this means that they have only one copy of each chromosome. ($n$)
Somatic cells are **diploid**, this means that they have 2 copies of each chromosome. ($2n$)
$$
haploid_{n}+haploid_{n}=diploid_{2n}
$$
**Homologous chromosomes** - matched pair both carry some *type* of gene, but each may have a slightly different version (*alleles*). 
![[SEXXXX-20240402110040017.webp]]**Crossing Over** - sister chromatids wrap their arms together and exchange DNA. Happens in metaphase I. 
**Random Alignment** - When the chromosomes line up in the middle there is no specific order for the chromosomes. This leads to the chromosomes lining up in a random order. 

# Errors
Chromosomes can fail to separate during anaphase I and II. This leads to disjunction. This leads to two of the resulting gametes having an extra chromosome and two gametes having a missing chromosome.
