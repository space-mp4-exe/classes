# Membrane Proteins
Only small, non polar things can move through a membrane without help.
**Transporter** - proteins that help other materials that move through the membrane.
**Enzyme** - Proteins that act as a catalyst for reactions.
**Active transportation** - using ATP and a transport protein to move something against the concentration gradient.
**Facilitated Diffusion** - Passive transport using a transport protein, so like a door in a busy hallway.

**Osmosis** - The movement of water across a semipermeable membrane. The solute that causes the water movement can't move across the membrane
**Isotonic** - Same amount of solute on both sides of a membrane. State where most cells want to live.

Cells spend around *70%* of their energy on active transport, a neuron spends *90%* of it's energy.
**ATP** - is used for energy in cells. It has one of its phosphate groups' bond broken to release energy. An ATP is broken and restored 1000-1500 time a day in a person.

Bacteria just do whatever they want.
