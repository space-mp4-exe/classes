Nerves control their concentration gradients by controlling the amount of Sodium (Na) and Potassium (K) in their membranes. Their movement is controlled by "voltage-gated" channels that can open and close based on voltage changes. 
neurons send their signal with a graded potential. From the dendrites, thru the cell body, all the way thru the axon. The signals down the axon are called an "action potential". 

RMP - -70mv
$E_n \; Na^+$ - +35mv
$E_k \; K^+$ - -90mv
# Action Potential
- **Resting** K leak channels are always open. Na/K pumps maintain Resting membrane potential (RMP)
- **Rising/Depolarization** When an action potential first arrives, the Na gate quickly swing open, depolarizing the membrane. At the same time the K gate opens slowly. 
- **Falling/Repolarization** Voltage-gated Na channels inactivate quickly. K channels open
- **Undershoot/Hyperpolarization** Voltage-gated K channels are slow to close. 
So if there is higher concentration than normal, this means that the membranes are *more positive*.
