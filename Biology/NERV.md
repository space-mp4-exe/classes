Nerves control their concentration gradients by controlling the amount of Sodium (Na) and Potassium (K) in their membranes. Their movement is controlled by "voltage-gated" channels that can open and close based on voltage changes. 
neurons send their signal with a graded potential. From the dendrites, thru the cell body, all the way thru the axon. The signals down the axon are called an "action potential". 

RMP - -70mv
$E_n \; Na^+$ - +35mv
$E_k \; K^+$ - -90mv
# Action Potential
- **Resting** K leak channels are always open. Na/K pumps maintain Resting membrane potential (RMP)
- **Rising/Depolarization** When an action potential first arrives, the Na gate quickly swing open, depolarizing the membrane. At the same time the K gate opens slowly. 
- **Falling/Repolarization** Voltage-gated Na channels inactivate quickly. K channels open
- **Undershoot/Hyperpolarization** Voltage-gated K channels are slow to close. 
So if there is higher concentration than normal, this means that the membranes are *more positive*.

# Effects of Drugs or Toxins
- **Presynaptic** - These drugs effect the synapse before the cleft, the one sending the signal. Drugs or toxins that effect this mess with the voltage-gated channels, Golgi apparatus, and the amount of $Ca^+$ outside of the neuron. 
- **Postsynaptic** - These drugs effect the synapse after the cleft, the one receiving the signal. These drugs of toxins effect the ligand gates, inhibit or enhance acetylcholinesterase activity, or damage the mitochondria or Na/K pumps.
